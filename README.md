# User-Driven-Customized-3D-Model-Generation-Using-Stable-Fast-3D-with-Inpainting

**Abstract**
This project presents a novel approach to generating high-quality 3D models from single 2D images by integrating the Stable Fast 3D (SF3D) reconstruction method with an advanced in- painting feature derived from Stable Diffusion. The primary goal is to enhance user interaction and customization in the 3D modeling process, allowing users to modify their input images according to specific preferences before initiating the reconstruction. SF3D is recognized for its rapid processing capabilities, achieving textured mesh generation in approximately 0.5 seconds while maintaining visual fidelity through techniques such as illumination disentanglement and material property prediction. The method effectively separates lighting effects from object textures, enabling realistic rendering under diverse conditions. Additionally, SF3D employs an enhanced transformer network for high-resolution triplane extraction and a fast UV unwrapping technique that streamlines the texture mapping process. Incorporating Stable Diffusion's in- painting feature allows users to seamlessly alter designated regions of the input images, facilitating corrections or enhancements that align with their creative vision. This capability not only improves the aesthetic quality of the 2D images but also ensures that the subsequent 3D models accurately reflect user intentions. The anticipated outcomes of this project include: High- Quality 3D Models: The integration of in-painting is expected to yield more visually appealing models by allowing for targeted modifications that enhance detail and realism. Efficiency in Processing: By combining the rapid processing times of SF3D with efficient in-painting, the aim is to achieve a total processing time of under one second per model, significantly reducing the time traditionally required for manual adjustments. User Engagement: The project aims to enhance user experience by providing an intuitive interface for image modification and 3D generation, thereby broadening accessibility for non-experts in digital content creation. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to advancements in computer vision and graphics by merging state-of- the-art AI techniques with practical applications in gaming, augmented reality (AR), and e- commerce. By enabling customizable 3D model generation from 2D images, the aim is to facilitate a more dynamic and interactive approach to digital asset creation.
